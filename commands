celery -A  rand worker --loglevel=INFO

To kill celery worker:
                pkill celery

To start redis:
                redis-server


running seperate tasks in seperate queue:
-------------------------------------------
first configure different tasks to different queue in apps configuration:

app = Celery('tasks',broker='amqp://localhost/', backend='redis://localhost') #'redis://localhost:6379/0'
app.conf.task_routes = {'task_1': {'queue': 'first_task_queue'}, 'task_2': {'queue': 'second_task_queue'}}

celery -A  rand worker --loglevel=INFO -n worker1  -Q first_task_queue
celery -A  rand worker --loglevel=INFO -n worker2  -Q second_task_queue

here rand == file name where tasks are written
worker is that we want to create a worker thread. there are others like beat etc
--loglevel = Info --> celery worker should print Information any any log above information level like errors, critical failures.
-n --> we are going to use a unique worker , after that we need to give it a name! Don't give 2 workers a same name!
worker1 and worker2 -- are name of workers we have created.
-Q -- these workers are going to look into a specific queue only for tasks to execute
then comes the Queue name

done! tasks will be executed by different workers executing from different queue!
